<h1><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bmFud-tDL.jpg"><p>20 Questions</p></a></h1><br>
<h2><p>Is it bigger than a breadbox?</p></h2><br>
<br>
<h4><p><i><strong>Yes</strong></i></p></h4><br>

<p>I have always been <b>tall</b>, <em>decidedly tall</em>. Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height. Starting at a young age, <br>
I would ask countless questions, from How heavy is the Earth? to Where does rain come from? <br>
My curiosity, displayed in questions like these, has truly defined me as a person and as a student. <br>
Therefore, it is not surprising that I became <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=transfixed+definition&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA763CA763&oq=transfixed+defe&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.4533j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" alt="ball.png" target="_blank">
transfixed</a> the first time I played 20Q (the electronic version of Twenty Questions). <br>
Somehow, a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking. <br>
The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in 20Q. <br>
This interest would later reveal valuable character traits of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life.<br>
<br>
Does it strive to learn?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
I became determined to discover how 20Q guessed correctly. After some research, <br>
I discovered artificial intelligence, more specifically, <br>
artificial neural networkssystems which learn and improve themselves. <br>
This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. <br>
I read avidly, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could. <br>
When given the opportunity years later, I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me. <br>
I found myself in an environment I loved. <br>
I would stay after class, go in during free periods, make my own apps, and work over Cloud-based IDEs. <br>
I prized the freedom and the possibilities.<br>
<br>
Is it driven?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
After my introduction to 20Q, I began to play Twenty Questions (the traditional parlor game) <br>
and became determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the artificial intelligence. <br>
At first I was mediocre. However, through long car rides with family, <br>
good-natured yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy, and time, I became more effective. <br>
I discovered the secrets to success: practice and perseverance.<br>
<br>
Does it apply what it learns?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
As 20Q implements what it learns, so do I. Throughout high school, I applied the secret of practice to my basketball career. <br>
I spent countless hours sharpening my skills in 90 summer heat to 20 late-winter cold, <br>
countless afternoons playing pickup games with my friends, and countless weekends traveling to AAU basketball tournaments. <br>
As a result, I became a starter for my schools varsity team. <br>
I applied another secret, this time the secret of perseverance, <br>
by dedicating myself to physical therapy after knee surgery in order to quickly return to football. <br>
Later that year, I became the first player in my grade to score a varsity touchdown.<br>
<br>
Does it attempt to better itself?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
Once I became proficient at Twenty Questions, I strengthened my resolve to become masterful. <br>
To do so, I needed to become a skillful inquisitor and to combine that with my analytical nature and interpersonal skills, <br>
all of which are vital for success in Twenty Questions. <br>
Because I had been debating politics with my friends since the 8th grade, I recognized that debate could sharpen these skills. <br>
I began to debate more frequently (and later more effectively) in English and government class, <br>
at the lunch table and family gatherings, and whenever the opportunity presented itself. <br>
This spurred in me an interest for how public policy and government work, <br>
leading me to attend Boys State and receive a nomination for The United States Senate Youth Program.<br>
<br>
Does it think deeply?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
So far, I have realized that thriving at Twenty Questions, just like life, is all about tenacity, rationality and interpersonal skills. <br>
I have found that, as in Twenty Questions, always succeeding is impossible; however, by persevering through difficulties and obstacles, <br>
favorable outcomes are often attainable. As I have become better at Twenty Questions, so too have I improved in many other aspects of my life.<br>
Nonetheless, I realize that I still have unbounded room to grow. <br>
And much like 20Q, I will continue to learn throughout my life and apply my knowledge to everything I do.<br>
<br>
Are you thinking of me?<br>
<br>
Yes.</p><br>
